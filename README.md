# Recursion Excercises

by HÃ©ctor Gonzalez Orozco

A couple of excercises that involve using recursion.

- The first creates an array with fibonacci numbers up to x. 

- The second is an implementation of the "merge sort" algorith.

Made as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion)'s curriculum.
